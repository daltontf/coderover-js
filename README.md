After reading a bit about Scala.js, I got this "itch" to port [coderover](https://github.com/daltontf/coderover) to it and not let the concept die of neglect. This way whatever "game" I incorporate the [CORAL](http://github.com/daltontf/coderover/wiki) language into would be runnable in a web page. 

The idea for "coderover" grew of a talk about parser combinators in Scala that I gave back in 2009 or 2010. As part of the the talk, I implemented a simple LOGO-like language with Swing UI for "turtle graphic" drawing. After that, I got this itch to implement a language where users write code to solve simple tasks.
